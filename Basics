#For new React Project: React is an library.
=> Attachments : react-dom,react-native.

=> when we want to work on websites we will use react-dom.

In Mobile Apps we will use both.

Steps:
when we have install node it comes with npm node package manager.

when we dont want it to install directly in system we will use npx node package executier.

cmds in terminal :

npx create-react-app file_name => create react app is a utility or a software.
never intall by this way its a bulky utility.

when we will install and go to that folder.
=> cd file_name
inside it will have many folders inside it.

so open firt package.json => we will see name,version,dependencies:for testing,and inside it it have 2 more libraries:rect,react-dom,
web vitals=> performance tracking how web is running.

scripts=> 
start: devlopment environmet mei project ko chalati hai.

build:build builts html,css and etc undersatands by browser. Its generated by build.

test: test the test cases.

eject: ejects the react when we dont want to run with react and would use other framework.

eslint=>error nahi but aur behtar kaam karo iskeliye.

browserlist=> which browser to use and tell about the browser in which it will work.

#How to Run Project?

need to run start script.
open teminal:
cd file_name
dir => we need to see package.json is there or not.

now yes if its there then write
cmd:
=>npm run start
now also run:
=>npm run buid



# as we know create-react-app is not that useful nowadays so will use vite.
vite is a bundluer 
=>npm create vite@latest
=>enter Project name
=>give react as a framework
=>javascript

now if we see there is no node folder in this so will do:
=>npm i //this will install all the packages.
=>npm run dev

# with every react project we have readme.md file and recomended to update it with every new project.

#SRC:
Is the folder in which we are going to work on 
=> first delete all the unnessary files which are coming automatically when we have installed.

#Project Stucture:(React-Basics)
for js we need to compulsory include script file in html.
now go to src => index.js
react is the core foundational library.

reactDom is the dom created by the react called as virtual dom.It only makes one virtual dom than compare with the main dom and only the required changes are done in it.
React-DOM : it is a tree str just like in js.
reder: html rendering
App ko render karo : jsx power=> just like that here we can render javascript ke through html tags ko render karo.jsx will look similarly like html.
so it is a way to create a custom tags.
=> strict mode is specifically for devlopment to do optimization.so if we not write strict mode also its ok.

now if we run the index we will see the same output and  in that we see one app named tag is present it directly goes to app.js

=> App.js => one function which is returning html and than the html is rendering that function.

What's this syntax?
This gives us the html programabilties.
so now we can see we didn't created any js file in index so how its locating?
so we can see in package .json it also gives one script file=> it is only responsible.


# Project Structure in Vite

Here we cant see any script in json file.
If we will open the index File then we can see the script file in it directly attached.=> main.jsx

JSX is nothing only js its for show off only in react.

Now make one file in vite -> src -> sample.js or jsx , jsx is mainly made to create a componenet in react.

when we made it and make a function in it and tghen export it into both main and app , in app it will first return some error bcz we have used .js  but vite tells that when we made a componenet we must give .jsx as an extension.
but also if we realod page dosent show anything then inspect and see error it says make it in the upper case.
and than we can see output.

=> Rule in jsx only return a single element.so return it insite the div tag or empty tag.
